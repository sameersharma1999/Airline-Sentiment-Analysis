321,negative,"@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers."
322,negative,@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
323,negative,@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.

339,negative,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
340,negative,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."
341,positive,@united thanks
342,positive,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
343,negative,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
344,negative,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
345,negative,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
346,positive,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•

356,negative,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
357,negative,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled

365,negative,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
366,negative,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient

378,negative,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
379,negative,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
380,negative,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
381,negative,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes

394,negative,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
395,negative,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .

399,negative,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
400,negative,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
401,negative,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
402,negative,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
403,negative,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
404,negative,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
405,positive,@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
406,positive,@united thx for update
407,negative,@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
408,negative,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
409,negative,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys

417,negative,@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
418,negative,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.
419,negative,@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
420,negative,@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
421,negative,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
422,negative,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice

426,negative,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
427,negative,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
428,negative,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
429,negative,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
430,negative,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
431,negative,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
432,negative,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."

434,negative,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought

437,negative,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
438,negative,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
439,negative,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
440,negative,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
441,negative,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
442,negative,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
443,negative,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
444,negative,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.

468,negative,@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
469,negative,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.

474,negative,"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
475,positive,@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
476,negative,@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
477,negative,@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
478,negative,@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
479,positive,@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
480,negative,@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
481,negative,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
482,negative,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
483,positive,@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
484,negative,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
485,negative,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
486,negative,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
487,negative,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
488,negative,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
489,negative,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
490,positive,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
491,negative,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
492,negative,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
493,negative,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
494,negative,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
495,negative,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
496,negative,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
497,positive,@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
498,negative,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
499,negative,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
500,negative,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
501,positive,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
502,positive,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
503,positive,"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
504,negative,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
505,negative,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
506,negative,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
507,negative,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
508,negative,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
509,negative,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
510,negative,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
511,negative,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
512,negative,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
513,positive,@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
514,negative,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
515,negative,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
516,negative,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
517,negative,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
518,negative,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
519,negative,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
520,positive,‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
521,negative,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
522,negative,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
523,negative,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
524,negative,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
525,negative,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
526,negative,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
527,negative,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
528,negative,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
529,negative,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
530,negative,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
531,positive,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
532,negative,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
533,negative,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
534,negative,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
535,negative,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
536,negative,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
537,negative,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
538,negative,‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
539,negative,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
540,negative,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
541,negative,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
542,positive,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
543,negative,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
544,positive,@united But thanks for asking
545,negative,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
546,negative,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
547,negative,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
548,negative,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
549,positive,@united you too!
550,positive,@united is my favorite airline.
551,negative,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
552,negative,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
553,negative,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
554,negative,@united why would they make me share a room?
555,negative,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
556,negative,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
557,negative,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
558,negative,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
559,negative,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
560,negative,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
561,negative,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
562,negative,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
563,positive,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
564,negative,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
565,negative,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
566,negative,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
567,negative,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
568,negative,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
569,positive,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
570,negative,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
571,negative,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
572,negative,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
573,negative,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
574,negative,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
575,negative,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
576,negative,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
577,negative,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
578,negative,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
579,negative,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
580,negative,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
581,negative,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
582,negative,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
583,negative,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
584,negative,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
585,negative,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
586,negative,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
587,negative,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
588,negative,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
589,negative,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
590,positive,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
591,positive,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
592,positive,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
593,negative,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
594,negative,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
595,negative,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
596,negative,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
597,negative,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
598,negative,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
599,negative,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
600,positive,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
601,negative,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
602,negative,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
603,positive,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
604,negative,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
605,negative,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
606,negative,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
607,negative,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
608,negative,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
609,negative,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
610,positive,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
611,negative,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control‚Äîthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
612,negative,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
613,negative,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
614,negative,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
615,negative,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
616,negative,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
617,negative,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
618,negative,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
619,negative,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
620,negative,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
621,positive,@united thank you.
622,negative,"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site‚Äîit's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
623,negative,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
624,negative,‚Äú@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP‚Äù what's the point of membership?
625,negative,@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
626,negative,@united Dmed you. Thank you
627,positive,@united thanks we'll be in touch!
628,positive,@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
629,negative,"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
630,positive,@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
631,negative,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
632,negative,"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
633,positive,Yes!! Thanks so much!!! üíú‚Äú@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY‚Äù
634,positive,"@united captain ""on behalf of the front office, welcome on board."".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain"
635,negative,@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
636,positive,@united These are great fares!!!!!
637,negative,@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
638,positive,@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
639,negative,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
640,positive,@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
641,negative,@united where's my damn bag??
642,negative,@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
643,negative,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
644,negative,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
645,negative,@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
646,negative,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
647,negative,@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
648,negative,@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
649,negative,@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
650,negative,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
651,positive,@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
652,negative,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
653,negative,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
654,negative,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
655,negative,@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
656,negative,@united So you are inadequate by accident?
657,positive,@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
658,positive,@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
659,negative,@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
660,negative,@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
661,negative,@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
662,negative,@united ...and when that doesn't work...
663,negative,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
664,negative,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
665,negative,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
666,negative,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
667,negative,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
668,negative,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
669,negative,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
670,positive,@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
671,negative,@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
672,negative,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
673,negative,@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
674,negative,@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
675,negative,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
676,negative,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
677,negative,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
678,positive,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
679,negative,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
680,negative,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
681,negative,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
682,negative,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
683,negative,@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
684,negative,"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
685,positive,@united Thank you!
686,positive,@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
687,negative,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
688,negative,@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
689,negative,"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
690,negative,@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
691,negative,@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
692,negative,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
693,negative,@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
694,negative,@united I did... no response back
695,negative,@united this is atrocious customer service.
696,negative,@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
697,negative,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
698,negative,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
699,negative,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
700,negative,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
701,negative,@united is the worst airline in the world.
702,negative,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
703,negative,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
704,negative,"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
705,negative,@united I will but right now I'm to angry
706,negative,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
707,negative,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
708,negative,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
709,negative,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
710,negative,@united I think DM would be better
711,negative,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
712,negative,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
713,negative,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
714,negative,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
715,negative,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
716,negative,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
717,negative,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
718,negative,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
719,negative,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
720,negative,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
721,negative,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
722,positive,@united thank you
723,negative,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
724,negative,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
725,negative,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
726,positive,@united he has no priority and Iove it
727,positive,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
728,negative,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
729,negative,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
730,negative,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
731,negative,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
732,negative,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
733,negative,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
734,negative,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
735,negative,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
736,negative,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
737,negative,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
738,positive,Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù
739,negative,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
740,positive,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
741,negative,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
742,negative,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
743,negative,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
744,negative,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
745,negative,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
746,positive,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
747,positive,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
748,positive,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
749,negative,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
750,negative,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
751,negative,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
752,negative,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
753,negative,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
754,negative,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
755,negative,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
756,negative,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
757,negative,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
758,positive,@united Ok thank again for your help!
759,negative,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
760,positive,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
761,positive,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
762,negative,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
763,negative,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
764,negative,"@united This must be a drone ‚Äú@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
765,negative,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
766,negative,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
767,negative,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
768,negative,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
769,negative,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
770,negative,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
771,positive,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
772,negative,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
773,negative,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
774,negative,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
775,positive,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
776,negative,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
777,negative,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
778,negative,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
779,negative,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
780,negative,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
781,negative,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
782,negative,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
783,negative,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
784,negative,@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
785,negative,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
786,positive,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
787,negative,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
788,negative,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
789,negative,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
790,negative,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
791,positive,@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
792,negative,@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
793,negative,"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
794,negative,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
795,negative,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
796,negative,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
797,negative,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
798,negative,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
799,positive,@united ok thx!
800,negative,@united go to hell
801,negative,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
802,negative,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
803,negative,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
804,positive,@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
805,positive,@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
806,negative,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
807,negative,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
808,positive,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
809,negative,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
810,negative,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
811,positive,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
812,positive,@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
813,negative,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
814,negative,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
815,negative,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
816,negative,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
817,negative,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
818,negative,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
819,positive,@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
820,positive,@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
821,negative,@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
822,negative,"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
823,positive,@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
824,positive,@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
825,negative,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
826,negative,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
827,positive,@united Just sent! Thanks :)
828,negative,@united already missed  connection ugh
829,negative,"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
830,negative,@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
831,negative,@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
832,negative,@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
833,negative,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
834,negative,@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
835,negative,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
836,negative,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
837,negative,@united that's not even an apology
838,negative,@united that's cool - now what?
839,negative,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
840,negative,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
841,negative,@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
842,negative,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
843,negative,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
844,negative,"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
845,negative,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
846,negative,@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
847,negative,"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"
848,negative,"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
849,negative,"@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981"
850,negative,@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
851,negative,"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
852,negative,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
853,negative,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
854,negative,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
855,negative,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
856,negative,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
857,negative,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
858,negative,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
859,negative,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
860,negative,@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
861,positive,@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
862,negative,@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
863,negative,"@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?"
864,negative,"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
865,negative,"@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"
866,negative,@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
867,negative,@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
868,negative,@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
869,negative,"@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
870,negative,"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"

878,negative,@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
879,positive,@united thank you!
880,positive,@united Thanks for the update.
881,negative,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
882,negative,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
883,negative,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
884,negative,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
885,positive,@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
886,negative,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
887,negative,@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
888,negative,@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
889,positive,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
890,negative,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
891,negative,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
892,negative,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
893,negative,"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
894,positive,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
895,negative,"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
896,negative,@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
897,negative,@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
898,positive,@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
899,negative,@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
900,negative,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
901,negative,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
902,negative,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
903,negative,@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
904,negative,@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
905,negative,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
906,negative,@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
907,negative,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
908,negative,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
909,negative,@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
910,negative,@united still no response??
911,negative,@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
912,negative,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
913,negative,@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
914,negative,@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
915,negative,@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
916,positive,@united Thanks!
917,negative,@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?

984,negative,@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
985,negative,@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
986,negative,"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."

995,negative,@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
996,positive,@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
997,negative,"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
998,negative,"@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback"

1003,negative,@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
1004,negative,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
1005,negative,"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
1006,positive,@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to youüòä http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E

1011,negative,@united literally sucks
1012,positive,@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
1013,negative,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
1014,negative,@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
1015,negative,@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?

1036,negative,@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
1037,negative,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
1038,negative,"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
1039,negative,@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
1040,negative,"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
1041,negative,"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
1042,negative,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.

1046,negative,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
1047,negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
1048,negative,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
1049,positive,@united I wanna be grand staff
1050,negative,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
1051,negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
1052,negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
1053,negative,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
1054,positive,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
1055,negative,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"

1057,negative,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
1058,negative,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
1059,negative,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
1060,negative,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
1061,negative,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
1062,negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
1063,negative,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
1064,negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
1065,negative,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
1066,negative,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
1067,negative,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
1068,negative,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
1069,negative,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
1070,negative,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
1071,negative,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
1072,negative,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
1073,negative,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
1074,negative,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
1075,negative,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
1076,negative,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
1077,positive,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
1078,negative,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
1079,negative,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
1080,negative,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
1081,positive,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
1082,negative,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
1083,negative,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
1084,negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
1085,negative,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
1086,negative,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
1087,negative,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
1088,negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
1089,negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
1090,negative,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
1091,negative,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
1092,negative,@united it will be on a different airline.

1097,negative,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
1098,negative,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
1099,negative,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
1100,negative,@united i need help but in spanish
1101,negative,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
1102,negative,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
1103,negative,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
1104,negative,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
1105,negative,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
1106,negative,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
1107,negative,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think

1117,negative,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
1118,negative,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
1119,negative,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
1120,negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
1121,negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
1122,negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
1123,negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
1124,negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
1125,negative,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
1126,positive,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
1127,negative,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS

1143,negative,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
1144,positive,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
1145,negative,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
1146,negative,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
1147,positive,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
1148,negative,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
1149,negative,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
1150,negative,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
1151,negative,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
1152,negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
1153,negative,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
1154,negative,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
1155,negative,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
1156,negative,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
1157,negative,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
1158,negative,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
1159,negative,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
1160,negative,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
1161,negative,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
1162,negative,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
1163,negative,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
1164,negative,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
1165,negative,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
1166,negative,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
1167,negative,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
1168,negative,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
1169,negative,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
1170,negative,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
1171,negative,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
1172,positive,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
1173,negative,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
1174,negative,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
1175,negative,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
1176,negative,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
1177,negative,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
1178,negative,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
1179,negative,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
1180,negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
1181,negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
1182,positive,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
1183,negative,@united lol too little too Late Flight
1184,negative,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
1185,negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
1186,negative,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
1187,negative,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
1188,negative,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
1189,negative,@united your seats are god awful.
1190,negative,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
1191,positive,@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
1192,negative,@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
1193,negative,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
1194,negative,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
1195,negative,@united i sure will
1196,negative,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
1197,negative,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
1198,negative,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
1199,negative,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
1200,negative,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
1201,negative,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
1202,negative,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
1203,positive,@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
1204,negative,@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
1205,negative,@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
1206,negative,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
1207,negative,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
1208,negative,@united I need help with a missing bag.
1209,negative,@united I was. But I have given up.
1210,negative,@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
1211,negative,@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
1212,negative,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
1213,negative,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
1214,negative,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
1215,negative,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
1216,negative,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
1217,negative,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
1218,negative,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
1219,negative,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
1220,negative,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
1221,negative,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
1222,positive,@united thank you for following up!
1223,positive,@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
1224,negative,"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
1225,negative,@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
1226,negative,@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
1227,negative,@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
1228,negative,@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
1229,negative,@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
1230,negative,@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
1231,negative,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
1232,negative,@united why do you hate your passengers?
1233,negative,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
1234,negative,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
1235,negative,@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
1236,negative,@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
1237,negative,@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
1238,negative,@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
1239,negative,@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
1240,negative,"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
1241,negative,"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
1242,positive,@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
1243,negative,"@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!"
1244,negative,@united false.

1246,positive,"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."
1247,negative,".@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"
1248,negative,@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.

1302,negative,@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
1303,positive,@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
1304,negative,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.

1313,positive,"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
1314,negative,@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter

1328,negative,@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
1329,negative,@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
1330,negative,@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
1331,negative,@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
1332,negative,@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
1333,negative,"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
1334,negative,@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!

1338,negative,@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
1339,negative,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
1340,negative,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
1341,negative,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
1342,negative,"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
1343,positive,@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
1344,negative,@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
1345,negative,@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
1346,negative,@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
1347,negative,"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."

1351,positive,"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
1352,negative,@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
1353,negative,@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
1354,negative,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
1355,negative,@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
1356,negative,@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
1357,negative,"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
1358,negative,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
1359,positive,"@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated"
1360,negative,"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
1361,negative,@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
1362,negative,@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
1363,negative,@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..

1368,negative,"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
1369,negative,@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
1370,negative,@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
1371,negative,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
1372,negative,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
1373,negative,@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.

1395,negative,@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
1396,negative,@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
1397,negative,@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
1398,negative,"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
1399,negative,"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."

1410,negative,"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
1411,negative,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
1412,negative,"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
1413,negative,"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
1414,negative,@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
1415,negative,@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
1416,negative,"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
1417,negative,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
1418,negative,@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
1419,negative,@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
1420,negative,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
1421,negative,"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
1422,negative,Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
1423,negative,@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!

1426,negative,@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
1427,negative,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
1428,negative,@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I

1443,negative,@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
1444,negative,@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
1445,negative,@united direct messages not going through please help
1446,negative,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
1447,negative,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
1448,negative,@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a

1453,negative,@united so what's the solution?
1454,negative,@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
1455,negative,@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
1456,negative,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
1457,positive,"@united we got it, thanks."
1458,negative,@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
1459,positive,"@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam"
1460,negative,@united severely under staffed at Iah.

1465,negative,"@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs"
1466,negative,@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues

1477,positive,@united THANK YOU!
1478,negative,@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
1479,negative,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
1480,negative,@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
1481,negative,@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
1482,negative,@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
1483,negative,@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
1484,negative,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
1485,negative,@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
1486,negative,@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
1487,negative,@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
1488,negative,@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
1489,negative,"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
1490,negative,@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
1491,positive,@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!

1493,negative,"@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together"
1494,negative,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
1495,negative,@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
1496,negative,@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
1497,negative,@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
1498,negative,@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
1499,negative,@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
1500,negative,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
1501,negative,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!

1504,negative,".@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO"
1505,negative,"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
1506,negative,@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
1507,negative,@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
1508,negative,@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
1509,negative,"@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?"
1510,positive,"@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back."
1511,negative,"@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?"
1512,negative,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
1513,negative,@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K

1519,negative,@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
1520,negative,@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
1521,negative,@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
1522,negative,"@united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc"

1529,negative,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
1530,negative,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
1531,negative,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
1532,negative,@united fuck you for not caring üò¢

1609,negative,"@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks"
1610,negative,"@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA."
1611,negative,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
1612,negative,Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
1613,negative,@united you hung up on me again.
1614,negative,"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
1615,negative,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
1616,negative,@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
1617,negative,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
1618,negative,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
1619,negative,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
1620,negative,@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
1621,negative,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
1622,negative,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
1623,negative,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
1624,negative,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
1625,negative,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
1626,negative,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
1627,negative,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
1628,negative,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
1629,negative,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
1630,negative,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
1631,negative,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
1632,negative,@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!

1639,negative,@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
1640,negative,"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
1641,negative,"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
1642,negative,"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
1643,negative,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
1644,positive,@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
1645,negative,@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
1646,negative,@united no apology? Cool.
1647,negative,"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
1648,negative,@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
1649,negative,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
1650,negative,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
1651,negative,@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
1652,negative,@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
1653,negative,@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
1654,negative,"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
1655,negative,"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
1656,negative,"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD"
1657,negative,@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
1658,positive,@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
1659,negative,"@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
1660,negative,@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
1661,negative,@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
1662,negative,@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo

1675,negative,@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
1676,negative,@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
1677,negative,"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
1678,negative,"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?"

1689,negative,@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
1690,negative,@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
1691,negative,@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
1692,negative,"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
1693,negative,@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
1694,negative,@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
1695,negative,@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
1696,negative,"@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards"
1697,negative,@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
1698,negative,@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
1699,negative,@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
1700,negative,@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
1701,negative,@united please get me off this plane #UA57
1702,negative,@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
1703,negative,@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
1704,negative,"@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
1705,negative,@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
1706,negative,@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
1707,negative,@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
1708,negative,@united can you make sure I‚Äôm on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
1709,positive,@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
1710,negative,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
1711,negative,"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
1712,negative,@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
1713,negative,"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
1714,negative,"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
1715,negative,@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
1716,negative,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
1717,negative,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
1718,negative,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
1719,negative,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
1720,negative,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
1721,negative,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
1722,negative,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
1723,negative,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
1724,negative,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
1725,negative,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
1726,negative,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
1727,negative,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
1728,negative,@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
1729,negative,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
1730,negative,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
1731,negative,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
1732,negative,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
1733,negative,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
1734,negative,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
1735,negative,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
1736,negative,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
1737,negative,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
1738,negative,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
1739,negative,@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
1740,negative,@united you're terrible.
1741,negative,@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
1742,negative,@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
1743,positive,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
1744,negative,"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
1745,negative,@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
1746,negative,@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
1747,negative,@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
1748,negative,@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
1749,positive,@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
1750,negative,@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
1751,negative,@united and waiting
1752,negative,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
1753,positive,@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
1754,negative,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
1755,negative,"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
1756,negative,@united is the worst
1757,negative,@united still waiting
1758,negative,"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
1759,negative,"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
1760,negative,@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
1761,negative,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
1762,negative,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
1763,negative,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
1764,negative,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
1765,negative,@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
1766,negative,@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
1767,negative,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
1768,positive,@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!

1772,negative,@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
1773,negative,"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
1774,negative,@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
1775,negative,@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
1776,negative,@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
1777,negative,@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
1778,negative,@united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
1779,negative,@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
1780,negative,@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
1781,negative,@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
1782,negative,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
1783,negative,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
1784,negative,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
1785,negative,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
1786,negative,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
1787,negative,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
1788,negative,@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
1789,negative,@united never again.
1790,positive,@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
1791,negative,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
1792,negative,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
1793,negative,@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
1794,positive,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
1795,negative,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
1796,negative,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
1797,negative,@united sucks.
1798,negative,@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
1799,negative,@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1800,negative,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
1801,positive,@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
1802,negative,@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
1803,negative,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
1804,negative,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
1805,negative,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
1806,negative,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
1807,positive,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
1808,negative,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
1809,negative,@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
1810,positive,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
1811,positive,"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"

1871,negative,@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
1872,negative,@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.

1874,positive,@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!

1898,negative,@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
1899,negative,@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
1900,negative,@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
1901,negative,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.

1915,negative,@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
1916,negative,"@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip"

1964,negative,@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
1965,negative,"@united no announcement re extra baggage, ""find an empty bin"" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing"
1966,negative,@united bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly @ContinentalAir1 Here's hoping @united wakes up

1968,negative,.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
1969,negative,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
1970,negative,@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
1971,negative,"@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage"
1972,negative,"fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA"

1981,negative,"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"
1982,negative,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
1983,negative,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
1984,negative,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
1985,negative,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
1986,negative,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
1987,negative,@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?

1992,negative,@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
1993,positive,@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
1994,negative,@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
1995,negative,@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
1996,negative,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
1997,negative,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
1998,negative,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
1999,negative,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.

2006,negative,@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
2007,negative,"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
2008,negative,@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
2009,negative,@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
2010,negative,@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6

2018,positive,@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
2019,negative,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
2020,negative,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"
2021,negative,@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
2022,negative,@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
2023,negative,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
2024,negative,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
2025,negative,@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
2026,negative,@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.

2128,negative,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!

2140,negative,@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.

2159,negative,@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
2160,negative,"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"

2162,negative,"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"

2182,positive,@united Thank You
2183,negative,"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
2184,negative,"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
2185,negative,. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful

2191,negative,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
2192,negative,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
2193,negative,@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!

2197,negative,@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
2198,negative,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
2199,negative,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
2200,negative,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"

2256,negative,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
2257,negative,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
2258,negative,@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
2259,negative,"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
2260,positive,‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
2261,negative,@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
2262,negative,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
2263,negative,"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark"
2264,negative,@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
2265,negative,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
2266,negative,@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
2267,negative,"@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly"
2268,negative,@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
2269,negative,@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
2270,negative,"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"
2271,negative,"@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!"
2272,negative,@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
2273,negative,"@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
2274,positive,@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
2275,negative,.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
2276,positive,@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
2277,negative,@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
2278,negative,"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
2279,positive,@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
2280,negative,@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
2281,negative,@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
2282,positive,@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
2283,negative,"@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day."
2284,negative,@united MIA-EWR #384 üòÑüòÑüòÑ excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 üò°üò°üò° No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
2285,negative,@united your customer service is crap.
2286,negative,@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
2287,positive,@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
2288,negative,@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
2289,positive,@united thanks
2290,negative,@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
2291,negative,"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
2292,negative,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
2293,negative,@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
2294,negative,@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
2295,negative,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
2296,positive,@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
2297,negative,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
2298,negative,"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
2299,negative,@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
2300,negative,@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
2301,negative,@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
2302,positive,@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
2303,negative,@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
2304,negative,@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
2305,negative,@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
2306,negative,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
2307,negative,@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
2308,negative,@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
2309,negative,@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
2310,positive,@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
2311,negative,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
2312,negative,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
2313,negative,@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
2314,positive,@united Thanks!
2315,positive,@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
2316,negative,@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
2317,positive,@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
2318,negative,"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"
2319,positive,Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
2320,negative,@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
2321,negative,@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
2322,positive,@united thanks for more timely updates.
2323,negative,@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
2324,negative,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
2325,negative,@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
2326,positive,@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
2327,negative,"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
2328,positive,@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
2329,negative,@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
2330,negative,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
2331,positive,@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
2332,positive,@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
2333,positive,"@united well played, ^LO."
2334,positive,@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
2335,negative,@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
2336,negative,@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
2337,negative,@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
2338,negative,@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. üòí
2339,negative,@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
2340,negative,@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
2341,negative,"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
2342,negative,@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
2343,negative,@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
2344,negative,"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."
2345,negative,@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
2346,negative,"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"
2347,negative,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
2348,negative,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
2349,negative,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
2350,negative,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
2351,negative,@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
2352,negative,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
2353,negative,@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
2354,negative,@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
2355,positive,@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
2356,negative,@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
2357,negative,@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
2358,negative,"@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?"
2359,negative,"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
2360,negative,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
2361,positive,"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
2362,positive,@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
2363,negative,@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
2364,positive,@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
2365,negative,@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
2366,negative,@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
2367,negative,@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
2368,negative,@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
2369,negative,"@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!"
2370,negative,@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
2371,negative,"@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH"
2372,positive,@united thnx!
2373,negative,@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
2374,negative,@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
2375,negative,@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
2376,negative,@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
2377,negative,@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
2378,negative,@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
2379,negative,"@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."
2380,negative,"@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united"
2381,positive,"@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better."
2382,negative,"@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board."
2383,negative,"@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours"
2384,negative,@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
2385,positive,"@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive"
2386,negative,"@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited"
2387,negative,"@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that ""sandwich."""
2388,negative,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
2389,negative,@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k

2392,negative,"@united define ""appreciate"". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback."
2393,negative,"@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip."
2394,positive,@united just sent - thank you!
2395,negative,@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
2396,negative,"@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation"
2397,negative,"@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?"
2398,negative,@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
2399,negative,@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
2400,positive,@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst
2401,negative,.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.

2403,positive,@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
2404,negative,@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
2405,negative,@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
2406,negative,@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
2407,negative,@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
2408,negative,@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
2409,negative,@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
2410,negative,@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
2411,negative,@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
2412,negative,@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
2413,negative,@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
2414,negative,@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
2415,negative,@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
2416,negative,@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
2417,positive,@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
2418,positive,"@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate."
2419,negative,@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
2420,negative,@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
2421,negative,@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
2422,negative,@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
2423,negative,.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
2424,negative,@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
2425,negative,@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
2426,negative,@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
2427,negative,@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
2428,negative,@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?

2430,positive,@united thnx ^LO :-)
2431,negative,"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
2432,negative,@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
2433,negative,@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
2434,negative,@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
2435,negative,"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
2436,negative,@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
2437,negative,"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
2438,negative,@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
2439,positive,@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
2440,negative,@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
2441,negative,"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
2442,negative,@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
2443,negative,@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
2444,negative,@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
2445,positive,@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm

2449,negative,@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
2450,negative,@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
2451,negative,@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
2452,negative,@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
2453,negative,@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
2454,negative,@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
2455,negative,"@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce"

2462,negative,@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
2463,negative,@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
2464,negative,@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
2465,negative,"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"
2466,negative,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
2467,negative,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
2468,negative,@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
2469,negative,"Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals"

2473,negative,"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
2474,negative,"@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos"
2475,negative,@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
2476,negative,"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
2477,negative,@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
2478,negative,@united its in black and white. EU law and all that ‚Ç¨600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
2479,negative,@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
2480,negative,"@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
2481,negative,"@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :("
2482,negative,@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd

2498,positive,@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
2499,negative,@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!

2501,negative,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
2502,negative,@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
2503,negative,"@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet."
2504,negative,@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
2505,negative,@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
2506,negative,.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again

2508,positive,@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!

2520,positive,@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
2521,negative,@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
2522,negative,"@united ‚Ç¨202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?"
2523,negative,"@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."
2524,negative,@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
2525,negative,@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm

2531,negative,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
2532,negative,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
2533,negative,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable

2557,negative,"@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match."
2558,negative,@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.üò°
2559,negative,@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
2560,negative,@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
2561,negative,@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
2562,negative,@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
2563,positive,@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.

2567,negative,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
2568,negative,@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
2569,negative,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
2570,negative,@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
2571,negative,"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
2572,negative,"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."

2575,negative,"@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are ‚Ç¨67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff"
2576,negative,@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
2577,negative,@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
2578,positive,@united Leaving soon. Thanks!

2581,negative,@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
2582,negative,@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
2583,negative,"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
2584,negative,@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
2585,negative,".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
2586,negative,@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
2587,negative,@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
2588,negative,@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
2589,negative,@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
2590,negative,@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
2591,negative,@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
2592,negative,@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
2593,negative,@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
2594,negative,@united silence is very telling
2595,negative,@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2

2597,negative,"@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM"
2598,negative,@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK

2609,negative,@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
2610,positive,@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
2611,negative,@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
2612,negative,"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
2613,negative,"@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont‚Ä¶"
2614,negative,@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
2615,negative,@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail

2625,negative,@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
2626,negative,"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
2627,negative,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
2628,negative,@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
2629,positive,"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
2630,negative,"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
2631,negative,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
2632,positive,"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
2633,negative,@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??

2652,negative,@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
2653,positive,@united perfect! Thank you!
2654,negative,@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....

2664,negative,@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?

2714,negative,"@united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks"
2715,negative,@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
2716,negative,@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
2717,negative,@united I'm a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I'm frustrated
2718,positive,@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
2719,negative,@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
2720,negative,"@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!"
2721,negative,@united Case ID 8544484
2722,negative,@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
2723,negative,@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
2724,positive,@United  great way to start my vacation with an on time departure! Looking forward to my global first class suite!
2725,negative,@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
2726,positive,@united Thank you for responding so promptly! I look forward to the 240 kms drive to the office to file a claim.
2727,positive,@united that would be great
2728,negative,"@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am"
2729,negative,@united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes.
2730,negative,"@united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo"
2731,positive,@united You're welcome.
2732,negative,@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
2733,negative,"@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer."
2734,positive,@united flt 1583 EWR to SFO excellent service. Friendly flight attendants. made the 6AM flight a very good start to the day.
2735,positive,@united Yes ! :D (Y) From @therealaviation on Instagram :)
2736,negative,@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
2737,negative,@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they‚Äôre interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
2738,negative,@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
2739,negative,@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
2740,negative,@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
2741,negative,@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
2742,negative,@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
2743,negative,"@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers."
2744,negative,@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn‚Äôt have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It‚Äôs a dumb delay.
2745,negative,@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
2746,negative,"@united I got an email saying ""changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed"" but I didn't make any changes. Help?"
2747,positive,@united Joni did a great job on flight 5653 to LAX. Thanks for a great flight.
2748,positive,@united So far so good. Just stepped down in Denver. Next Stop Portland!
2749,negative,@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
2750,negative,@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
2751,negative,@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
2752,positive,@united #OrthoDoc on-call to in-flight! Glad to have been of service!
2753,negative,"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
2754,positive,@united flight attendant regains karma by giving big sweaty dad cold water. Guy was running &amp; carrying his daughter.  Last one onboard.
2755,negative,"@united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus"
2756,negative,@united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
2757,positive,@united I just want shout out a thank the pilots and staff on the Feb 13 flight from Newark to Boston at 4:40pm.  They were super helpful!
2758,negative,@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
2759,negative,"@united That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôve been 1K for over 5 years, and you‚Äôre making it harder to keep me loyal."
2760,negative,"@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that"
2761,positive,@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United&gt;
2762,negative,@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
2763,negative,"@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened"
2764,negative,@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
2765,negative,@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
2766,negative,"@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?"
2767,negative,@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
2768,negative,@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
2769,negative,"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"
2770,negative,@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
2771,negative,@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
2772,negative,@united I‚Äôve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
2773,positive,@united message sent. Thank you!
2774,negative,@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
2775,negative,"@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?"
2776,negative,"@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight...."
2777,negative,"@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead"
2778,negative,"@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless"
2779,negative,@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
2780,negative,@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
2781,negative,@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
2782,negative,@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
2783,positive,@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
2784,negative,@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
2785,negative,@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
2786,positive,@united Thanks JT
2787,positive,@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
2788,negative,@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
2789,negative,@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
2790,negative,".@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now."
2791,negative,@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
2792,negative,@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed
2793,negative,@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
2794,negative,@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
2795,negative,"@united booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err ""no segment in this"""
2796,negative,"@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!"
2797,negative,"@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated."
2798,negative,@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
2799,positive,@united Thank you!! üòä
2800,negative,@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
2801,negative,@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
2802,negative,@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
2803,negative,@united thx. Come hell or high water...
2804,negative,"@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting"
2805,negative,@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
2806,positive,@united thanks for the quick reply! I just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon
2807,negative,"@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho."
2808,positive,@united that's fine. I'll take them.
2809,negative,"@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?"
2810,positive,@united thank you! My second flight I already got bumped up to 1st! Love it!
2811,negative,@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
2812,negative,@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
2813,negative,@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
2814,negative,@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
2815,positive,"@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks."
2816,negative,@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
2817,negative,@united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I'll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica...
2818,negative,@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
2819,negative,@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
2820,negative,@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
2821,negative,"@united : Unhappy with United's service?

2822,negative,@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
2823,negative,@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
2824,negative,@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
2825,positive,@united OMG THANK Uüòªüòªüòª
2826,negative,@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
2827,negative,@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
2828,negative,"@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting..."
2829,negative,@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
2830,negative,"@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag..."
2831,negative,@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
2832,negative,"@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn‚Äôt carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free."
2833,negative,@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
2834,negative,@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
2835,positive,@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
2836,negative,@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
2837,negative,"@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround"
2838,negative,@united @staralliance the B gates are very far though
2839,negative,"@united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels"
2840,negative,@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
2841,negative,@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
2842,positive,@united did I win :)
2843,negative,@united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
2844,negative,@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
2845,negative,"@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!"
2846,positive,@united flight to RSW tonight -me &amp;  twin 3 year olds. A pilot who was in row by me stayed to help me get the boys &amp; bags off. Lifesaver!!
2847,negative,@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
2848,positive,"@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20)."
2849,negative,@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
2850,negative,@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
2851,negative,@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
2852,negative,"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
2853,negative,@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
2854,negative,@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
2855,negative,@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
2856,negative,@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
2857,negative,"@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation."
2858,negative,@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
2859,negative,"@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
2860,negative,@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
2861,negative,"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
2862,negative,@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
2863,negative,@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
2864,negative,@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
2865,negative,@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
2866,negative,"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"
2867,negative,@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
2868,negative,@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
2869,negative,@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
2870,negative,"@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!"
2871,positive,@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
2872,negative,"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
2873,negative,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
2874,negative,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
2875,positive,"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"
2876,negative,@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
2877,positive,@united thanks
2878,negative,@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
2879,positive,"@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1"

2883,negative,@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
2884,positive,"@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!"
2885,negative,@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
2886,negative,@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
2887,negative,@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
2888,positive,"@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails"
2889,positive,"@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here."
2890,positive,"@united Very good flight, thank you!"
2891,negative,@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
2892,negative,@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
2893,positive,"@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!"
2894,negative,@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
2895,negative,@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
2896,negative,@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
2897,positive,"@united Thanks, I will!"
2898,negative,@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
2899,negative,@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
2900,positive,@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
2901,positive,"@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!"
2902,positive,@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
2903,positive,"@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)"
2904,negative,@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
2905,negative,@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
2906,negative,@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
2907,negative,"@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times."
2908,negative,@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
2909,negative,@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
2910,positive,"@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS"
2911,negative,@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
2912,negative,"@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?"
2913,positive,@united thnx
2914,positive,"@united 
I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years.
You've still got me hooked.
(for now!)
Peace."
2915,positive,@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
2916,negative,@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren‚Äôt going to improve my poor airport experiences.
2917,negative,@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
2918,positive,@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
2919,negative,"@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï"
2920,positive,@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
2921,positive,"@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated."
2922,negative,"@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded."
2923,negative,@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
2924,negative,"@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ"
2925,negative,@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
2926,positive,@united @parryaftab done thnx
2927,negative,"@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD"
2928,negative,"@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection."
2929,negative,"@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am"
2930,negative,@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
2931,negative,@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
2932,positive,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
2933,negative,"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
2934,positive,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"
2935,negative,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
2936,positive,@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
2937,positive,"@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! @AmericanAir"

2942,negative,"@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."
2943,negative,@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
2944,negative,@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
2945,negative,@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
2946,negative,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
2947,positive,"@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)"
2948,negative,"@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11"
2949,negative,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
2950,negative,@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
2951,negative,@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
2952,negative,@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
2953,negative,@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
2954,negative,@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
2955,negative,@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
2956,negative,@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
2957,negative,@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
2958,negative,@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
2959,negative,@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on

2963,negative,"‚Äú@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT‚Äù A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
2964,negative,@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
2965,negative,@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
2966,negative,"@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?"
2967,positive,"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
2968,positive,@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
2969,negative,@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
2970,negative,"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united"
2971,negative,@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
2972,negative,"@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed."
2973,negative,@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
2974,positive,@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
2975,positive,"@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)"
2976,negative,@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
2977,negative,"@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there."
2978,negative,@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
2979,negative,"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
2980,negative,@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
2981,negative,"@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466"
2982,positive,@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
2983,negative,"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
2984,negative,@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
2985,negative,"@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!"
2986,positive,@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
2987,negative,"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"
2988,negative,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
2989,negative,@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
2990,negative,"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?"
2991,negative,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
2992,negative,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
2993,negative,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
2994,negative,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
2995,negative,"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."
2996,positive,@united thank you!
2997,positive,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
2998,negative,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
2999,negative,"@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found."
3000,negative,@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
3001,negative,"@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15"
3002,positive,@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
3003,negative,"@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice"
3004,negative,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
3005,negative,@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow üò≠
3006,negative,"@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight."
3007,negative,@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
3008,negative,@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
3009,negative,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
3010,negative,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
3011,negative,"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
3012,negative,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
3013,positive,"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"
3014,positive,@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked üëç
3015,negative,"@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience"
3016,negative,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
3017,negative,@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
3018,negative,"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
3019,negative,@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
3020,negative,"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help."
3021,negative,@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
3022,negative,@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
3023,negative,@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
3024,negative,"@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee."
3025,negative,"@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?"
3026,negative,@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
3027,negative,@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
3028,negative,"@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?"
3029,negative,"@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ"

3032,positive,@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
3033,negative,@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
3034,negative,@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
3035,negative,@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
3036,positive,@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
3037,negative,@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
3038,negative,@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
3039,negative,@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
3040,negative,@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
3041,negative,@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
3042,negative,"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
3043,negative,@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
3044,negative,@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
3045,negative,"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
3046,negative,@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
3047,negative,"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
3048,negative,@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
3049,negative,"@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way"
3050,positive,"@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs."
3051,negative,"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
3052,negative,1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
3053,negative,@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
3054,negative,@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
3055,negative,"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
3056,negative,"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"
3057,negative,@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
3058,positive,@united it's amazing really.
3059,negative,@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
3060,negative,"@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn"
3061,positive,"@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US."
3062,negative,@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
3063,negative,"@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP"
3064,negative,@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.

3071,negative,@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
3072,negative,@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
3073,negative,"@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail"
3074,negative,@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
3075,positive,@united no worries Your customer service gets a bad wrap but just spoke w agent who saved me huge amounts of time &amp; apologized for yesterday
3076,negative,@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
3077,negative,@united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis

3082,negative,"@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned ""confirmed"" certificates?"
3083,negative,"@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn't make an announcement"
3084,negative,@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.
3085,negative,@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
3086,negative,"@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!"
3087,negative,"@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline."
3088,negative,@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is

3096,negative,. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
3097,negative,@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
3098,positive,"@united Great, thank you!"
3099,negative,@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!

3101,negative,"@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT."
3102,negative,@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
3103,negative,@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
3104,negative,"@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would."

3108,negative,@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
3109,negative,@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
3110,negative,@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
3111,negative,@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.

3151,negative,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
3152,negative,@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
3153,negative,"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"
3154,negative,@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
3155,positive,@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
3156,negative,@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
3157,negative,"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
3158,negative,"@united unless it's on you guys, im good."
3159,negative,@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
3160,negative,"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."
3161,negative,@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
3162,negative,@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
3163,positive,@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
3164,negative,@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
3165,negative,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
3166,positive,@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
3167,negative,@united RTB&gt;IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls
3168,negative,"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"
3169,negative,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
3170,negative,@united do you guys have any working planes?
3171,negative,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
3172,negative,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it."
3173,negative,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
3174,negative,@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
3175,positive,"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
3176,negative,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
3177,positive,@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
3178,negative,@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
3179,negative,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
3180,negative,"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
3181,negative,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
3182,positive,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
3183,negative,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
3184,negative,@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...

3186,negative,@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
3187,negative,@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...

3189,negative,@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
3190,negative,"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
3191,negative,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
3192,negative,"@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
3193,negative,"@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum"

3195,positive,@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
3196,negative,"@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that."
3197,positive,@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
3198,negative,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
3199,negative,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
3200,negative,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
3201,negative,@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
3202,negative,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
3203,negative,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?"
3204,negative,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won‚Äôt fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go‚Ä¶?"
3205,negative,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
3206,negative,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
3207,negative,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
3208,negative,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
3209,positive,"Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors ‚Äú@united: We‚Äôre bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"""
3210,negative,@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
3211,negative,@united how else would I know it was denied?
3212,negative,"@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited"
3213,negative,@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
3214,negative,@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
3215,positive,"@united be  ""Chicago's hometown airline"" care about your neighbors #SaveTheDiagonals #FlyQuiet #ORDNoise"
3216,negative,@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
3217,positive,@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.
3218,positive,@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
3219,negative,"@united I can‚Äôt go back to the airport, I‚Äôm working, and won‚Äôt have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?"
3220,negative,@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
3221,negative,@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
3222,negative,@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
3223,negative,@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
3224,negative,@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
3225,positive,@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
3226,negative,@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
3227,negative,"@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst."
3228,positive,"@United Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY"
3229,negative,@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
3230,negative,@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
3231,negative,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
3232,negative,@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
3233,negative,@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
3234,negative,"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
3235,negative,"@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air."
3236,positive,@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
3237,negative,@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
3238,negative,"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
3239,positive,"@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!"
3240,negative,@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
3241,negative,@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
3242,positive,@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
3243,positive,"@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere"
3244,negative,"@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this."
3245,negative,@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
3246,negative,"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
3247,negative,@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
3248,positive,"@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!"
3249,positive,@united ooh thanks!
3250,negative,"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
3251,negative,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
3252,negative,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
3253,negative,I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
3254,negative,"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
3255,negative,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
3256,negative,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
3257,negative,"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"
3258,negative,@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
3259,negative,@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
3260,positive,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
3261,negative,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
3262,negative,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
3263,negative,@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
3264,negative,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
3265,negative,"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
3266,negative,@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
3267,negative,@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
3268,negative,@united can you not see the thread?
3269,negative,@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
3270,negative,@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
3271,negative,@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
3272,positive,@united thanks! :)
3273,negative,"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
3274,negative,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
3275,negative,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
3276,negative,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
3277,negative,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
3278,negative,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
3279,negative,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
3280,negative,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
3281,negative,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
3282,negative,@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé
3283,negative,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
3284,negative,@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
3285,negative,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
3286,negative,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
3287,negative,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
3288,negative,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
3289,negative,"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
3290,negative,"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
3291,negative,@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
3292,negative,@united Classic
3293,positive,@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
3294,positive,@united Thanks!
3295,negative,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
3296,negative,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
3297,negative,"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
3298,negative,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
3299,negative,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
3300,negative,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
3301,negative,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
3302,negative,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
3303,negative,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
3304,negative,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
3305,negative,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
3306,negative,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
3307,negative,@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
3308,negative,@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
3309,positive,@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home
3310,negative,"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
3311,positive,@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
3312,negative,@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
3313,negative,@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
3314,negative,@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
3315,negative,"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
3316,negative,@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
3317,negative,@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
3318,negative,"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
3319,negative,@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
3320,positive,@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
3321,negative,@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
3322,positive,"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
3323,negative,@united worst service ever üòà
3324,negative,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
3325,negative,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
3326,negative,@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
3327,positive,@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
3328,negative,@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
3329,negative,@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..üò°...
3330,negative,"@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday"
3331,positive,@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
3332,positive,"@united done just now, thanks."
3333,negative,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
3334,negative,@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
3335,negative,"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
3336,negative,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
3337,negative,@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
3338,negative,@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
3339,negative,"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
3340,negative,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
3341,negative,"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."
3342,positive,@united thank you! üòä
3343,negative,@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
3344,negative,@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
3345,negative,@united customer service üëé
3346,negative,@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
3347,negative,@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
3348,negative,.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2

3356,negative,@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
3357,negative,"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
3358,positive,Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
3359,negative,"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
3360,negative,@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
3361,negative,@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
3362,negative,@united you are really trying me today.
3363,positive,@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
3364,negative,@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
3365,negative,@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
3366,negative,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
3367,negative,"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
3368,positive,"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
3369,negative,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
3370,negative,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
3371,negative,@united who can tell me where they are?
3372,negative,"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
3373,negative,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!

3375,negative,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
3376,negative,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.

3383,negative,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
3384,negative,@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
3385,negative,@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail

3419,positive,"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
3420,negative,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
3421,negative,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
3422,negative,.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
3423,positive,"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""

3440,negative,@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
3441,negative,@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations

3650,negative,@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?

4475,positive,@SouthwestAir Jackpot!  #legroom http://t.co/ZO2iceG4lI
4476,negative,"@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!"
4477,negative,@SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
4478,positive,"@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +"
4479,negative,@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
4480,negative,"@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?"
4481,negative,@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
4482,negative,"@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
4483,negative,@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
4484,negative,@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
4485,negative,@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
4486,positive,@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.
4487,positive,@SouthwestAir Received awesome phone help from Jim today. Helped me switch around flights booked with points.
4488,negative,"@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP"
4489,negative,"@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
4490,negative,@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
4491,negative,"@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???"
4492,negative,@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
4493,negative,@SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected.
4494,negative,@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
4495,positive,@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
4496,negative,@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
4497,positive,@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!
4498,negative,"@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI."

4510,negative,"@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????"
4511,negative,@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?

4541,negative,@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
4542,negative,"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
4543,negative,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
4544,negative,@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels

4552,negative,@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
4553,positive,@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
4554,negative,@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
4555,negative,@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
4556,positive,@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
4557,negative,@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.

5301,negative,@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
5302,negative,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
5303,negative,@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
5304,negative,@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
5305,negative,"@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)"

5577,negative,@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
5578,negative,@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
5579,negative,@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
5580,negative,@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
5581,positive,@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus

5589,negative,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
5590,negative,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
5591,negative,@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue

5596,negative,"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
5597,negative,@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
5598,negative,"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
5599,negative,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
5600,negative,"@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot"
5601,negative,@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
5602,negative,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
5603,negative,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
5604,negative,@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
5605,negative,"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
5606,negative,@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
5607,negative,"@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
5608,negative,@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
5609,negative,@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
5610,negative,@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
5611,negative,@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
5612,negative,"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
5613,negative,@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
5614,negative,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
5615,positive,"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
5616,negative,@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
5617,negative,"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
5618,negative,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
5619,negative,@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
5620,negative,"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
5621,negative,@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
5622,negative,@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
5623,negative,@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
5624,negative,@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
5625,negative,"@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!"
5626,negative,"@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA‚úàÔ∏èBOS"
5627,negative,@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
5628,negative,@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
5629,negative,@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
5630,positive,"@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock"
5631,positive,@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
5632,negative,@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
5633,negative,@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
5634,negative,@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
5635,positive,@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
5636,negative,"@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in."
5637,negative,@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
5638,negative,@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
5639,positive,@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! üôå‚úàÔ∏è
5640,negative,"@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue."
5641,negative,"@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!"
5642,negative,@JetBlue does not fit in 140
5643,positive,@JetBlue love it as always!
5644,negative,"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
5645,negative,"@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??"
5646,negative,"@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?"
5647,positive,"@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!"
5648,negative,"@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï"
5649,negative,"@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!"
5650,negative,@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
5651,negative,@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
5652,positive,@JetBlue thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è
5653,negative,@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
5654,negative,@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight üòï
5655,negative,"@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!"
5656,negative,@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
5657,positive,@JetBlue you guys rock!
5658,positive,@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ‚ò∫üëçüëç
5659,positive,@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
5660,negative,@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
5661,negative,@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
5662,negative,"@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(
I look forward to that do much!"
5663,negative,@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
5664,negative,"@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip."
5665,negative,"@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ."
5666,positive,@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
5667,positive,@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
5668,positive,@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
5669,positive,@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
5670,negative,@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
5671,positive,@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
5672,negative,"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
5673,negative,@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
5674,negative,@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
5675,negative,"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
5676,negative,@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
5677,negative,@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
5678,negative,@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
5679,negative,@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
5680,negative,@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
5681,negative,@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
5682,negative,@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
5683,negative,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
5684,positive,"‚Äú@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!‚Äù Thank you!"
5685,negative,@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
5686,negative,"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
5687,negative,.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
5688,negative,@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
5689,negative,"@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
5690,positive,@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
5691,negative,"@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"
5692,negative,@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
5693,negative,"@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy..."
5694,negative,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
5695,negative,"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
5696,negative,@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
5697,negative,@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
5698,negative,"@JetBlue, your hold music sucks."
5699,negative,"@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too."
5700,negative,@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
5701,negative,"@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped."
5702,negative,@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
5703,negative,@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.

5710,negative,"@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
5711,negative,@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
5712,negative,@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE

5721,positive,"@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!"
5722,negative,@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
5723,negative,"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
5724,negative,@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.

5744,negative,@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
5745,negative,@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.

5749,negative,@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
5750,negative,@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
5751,negative,@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
5752,negative,@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board

5757,negative,"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"

6139,negative,@JetBlue I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this?

6164,positive,@JetBlue that is great. But once it gets to Buffalo will it be able to leave and get to JFK? Or there's issues still at Buffalo airport?
6165,negative,@JetBlue why do you have every channel but @ABCNetwork How are @kgonzales89 and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet!

6176,negative,@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
6177,negative,@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail

6215,negative,"@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight..."
6216,negative,@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
6217,negative,"@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed."
6218,negative,@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...

6230,positive,@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
6231,negative,"@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
6232,negative,@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
6233,negative,@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
6234,positive,@JetBlue thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly

6236,positive,"@JetBlue:  Ahoy from a loyal #AllYouCanJetPass holder! When do you anticipate direct US flights to #Havana, #Cuba? (#JetBlue #Vacation)"
6237,negative,@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
6238,negative,@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
6239,negative,"@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans"
6240,positive,"@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)"

6244,negative,@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
6245,positive,@JetBlue thanks to Julian at login for getting me onto an earlier flight back to DCA
6246,negative,"@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?"
6247,negative,@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
6248,positive,Not your fault @JetBlue Social Media Awesome People. I know everyone is working hard to get us in our way.
6249,negative,@JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
6250,positive,@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
6251,negative,"@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue."
6252,negative,@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
6253,negative,@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
6254,positive,@JetBlue thanks
6255,positive,@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
6256,negative,"@JetBlue No, it didn't all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked."
6257,negative,@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
6258,negative,"@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept."
6259,positive,@JetBlue we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels.
6260,negative,"@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert."

6263,negative,@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
6264,negative,@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
6265,negative,@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?

6267,negative,@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
6268,negative,@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
6269,positive,@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)
6270,negative,@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.

6568,negative,@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!

6579,negative,"@JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?"
6580,negative,"@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :("

6586,negative,"@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves."
6587,negative,@JetBlue that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.
6588,negative,"@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2"
6589,negative,@JetBlue tell your employees that!

6595,positive,@JetBlue That's great! Thank you.
6596,negative,@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official

6602,negative,@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
6603,negative,"@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?"
6604,negative,"@JetBlue dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75"
6605,negative,@JetBlue the TV. Wifi was spotty. It's just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won't keep us away #lovejetblue
6606,negative,@JetBlue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?
6607,negative,@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.

6689,positive,@JetBlue Seems very likely.
6690,negative,@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting

6780,negative,@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
6781,negative,@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
6782,negative,@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
6783,positive,@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
6784,negative,@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!

6792,negative,@USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection.
6793,negative,"@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your ""go to"" maneuver?"
6794,positive,@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
6795,negative,"@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable."
6796,negative,@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
6797,negative,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
6798,negative,@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
6799,negative,@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU

6802,negative,@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
6803,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
6804,negative,@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
6805,negative,@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
6806,negative,@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
6807,negative,@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem

6814,negative,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
6815,positive,"@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!"
6816,positive,@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
6817,negative,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
6818,negative,@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
6819,negative,@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
6820,negative,@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
6821,negative,@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
6822,positive,@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
6823,negative,@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
6824,negative,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
6825,negative,"@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate."
6826,negative,@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu

6842,negative,"@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic"
6843,negative,@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
6844,negative,@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
6845,negative,@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
6846,negative,@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
6847,positive,@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
6848,negative,@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.

6857,negative,@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
6858,negative,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
6859,negative,@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
6860,negative,@USAirways can't get back lost time
6861,negative,@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired

6863,negative,@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14

6869,negative,@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
6870,negative,@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
6871,negative,@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
6872,negative,@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
6873,negative,@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
6874,negative,"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open

6877,negative,@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
6878,negative,"@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I"

6893,negative,@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
6894,negative,@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
6895,negative,"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"

6936,negative,"@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers"
6937,positive,@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
6938,negative,@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
6939,negative,@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
6940,negative,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
6941,positive,@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
6942,negative,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
6943,negative,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
6944,negative,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
6945,negative,@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
6946,negative,@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
6947,negative,@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
6948,negative,"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
6949,negative,"Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options."
6950,negative,"@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt."
6951,negative,@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
6952,negative,@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
6953,negative,@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
6954,negative,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
6955,negative,@USAirways very embarrassing.
6956,negative,@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
6957,negative,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
6958,negative,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
6959,negative,@USAirways and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be Late Flight.
6960,negative,@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
6961,positive,@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
6962,negative,"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
6963,negative,@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
6964,negative,@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
6965,negative,@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
6966,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
6967,negative,"@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight."
6968,negative,"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
6969,negative,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
6970,negative,"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
6971,negative,@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
6972,positive,@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
6973,negative,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
6974,negative,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
6975,negative,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
6976,negative,"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
6977,negative,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
6978,negative,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
6979,negative,"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
6980,negative,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
6981,negative,@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
6982,negative,@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
6983,negative,.@USAirways Have you just given up?
6984,negative,.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
6985,negative,@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
6986,negative,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
6987,positive,Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
6988,negative,@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
6989,negative,@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
6990,negative,@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
6991,negative,@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
6992,positive,@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
6993,negative,@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
6994,negative,@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
6995,negative,@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
6996,negative,"@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!"
6997,negative,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
6998,negative,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
6999,negative,@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
7000,negative,@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
7001,positive,@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
7002,negative,@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
7003,positive,@USAirways ok thanks
7004,negative,@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
7005,negative,@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
7006,negative,@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
7007,negative,"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"
7008,positive,@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
7009,negative,@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
7010,negative,@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
7011,positive,"@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos."
7012,negative,@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
7013,negative,@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
7014,negative,"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
7015,positive,@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
7016,negative,@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
7017,negative,@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
7018,negative,@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
7019,negative,@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags
7020,negative,@USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again
7021,negative,@USAirways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road
7022,negative,@USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock.
7023,negative,@USAirways power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was
7024,negative,@USAirways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on.
7025,positive,@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
7026,negative,"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
7027,negative,@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
7028,negative,@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
7029,negative,@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
7030,negative,@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
7031,negative,@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
7032,positive,@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
7033,negative,@USAirways the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c
7034,negative,@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
7035,negative,@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
7036,negative,@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
7037,negative,@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
7038,negative,@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
7039,negative,@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
7040,negative,@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
7041,negative,@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
7042,negative,@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
7043,positive,@USAirways I made it! Thanks for the help!
7044,positive,@USAirways - Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
7045,negative,@USAirways I have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while Flight Booking Problems. Pls help
7046,negative,@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
7047,negative,@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
7048,negative,@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
7049,negative,"@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would."
7050,negative,@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
7051,negative,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
7052,negative,@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
7053,negative,@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
7054,negative,@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
7055,negative,@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
7056,negative,@USAirways too Late Flight.
7057,negative,@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
7058,positive,@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
7059,positive,@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
7060,negative,@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
7061,negative,@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
7062,positive,"@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)"
7063,negative,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
7064,negative,@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
7065,negative,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
7066,negative,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
7067,negative,"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
7068,negative,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
7069,negative,@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
7070,negative,@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
7071,negative,@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
7072,negative,"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
7073,negative,"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
7074,negative,"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
7075,negative,@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
7076,negative,"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
7077,negative,"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
7078,negative,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
7079,negative,@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
7080,negative,@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
7081,negative,"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
7082,negative,@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
7083,negative,"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
7084,negative,"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
7085,negative,@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
7086,negative,@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
7087,negative,@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
7088,negative,"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."
7089,negative,"@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?"
7090,negative,@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
7091,negative,"@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx."
7092,negative,@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
7093,negative,@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
7094,negative,"@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go."
7095,negative,@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
7096,negative,@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
7097,negative,"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
7098,negative,@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
7099,negative,"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
7100,negative,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
7101,negative,@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
7102,negative,@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
7103,negative,@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
7104,negative,@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
7105,negative,"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
7106,negative,@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
7107,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
7108,negative,@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
7109,negative,@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
7110,negative,@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
7111,negative,@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
7112,positive,@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! üëç
7113,negative,"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
7114,negative,@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
7115,negative,@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
7116,negative,"@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight"
7117,negative,"@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service"
7118,negative,"@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways"
7119,positive,@USAirways They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you.
7120,negative,"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
7121,positive,"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"
7122,negative,@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
7123,negative,@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
7124,negative,@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
7125,negative,@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
7126,negative,@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
7127,negative,@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
7128,negative,@USAirways how long for a reply
7129,positive,@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
7130,negative,@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
7131,negative,@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
7132,negative,@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
7133,negative,@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
7134,negative,.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
7135,negative,"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
7136,negative,@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
7137,negative,@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
7138,negative,"@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077"
7139,negative,"@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever."
7140,negative,@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
7141,negative,@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
7142,negative,@USAirways Your system is affected by the weather?
7143,positive,@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
7144,negative,@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating

7250,negative,"@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help"
7251,negative,@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
7252,negative,"@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise"

7254,negative,"@USAirways. wow, awful customer service."
7255,negative,@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.

7261,negative,@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
7262,negative,"@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again."

7265,negative,@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this longüòí
7266,negative,@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
7267,negative,@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
7268,negative,@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)

7275,negative,@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
7276,negative,@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
7277,negative,@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
7278,negative,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
7279,negative,@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
7280,negative,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
7281,negative,@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
7282,negative,"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"

7289,negative,@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
7290,negative,"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled."
7291,negative,@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
7292,negative,@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?

7303,negative,@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.

8179,positive,@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
8180,negative,@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
8181,negative,@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
8182,negative,@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
8183,negative,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
8184,negative,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
8185,negative,"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."
8186,negative,"@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime"
8187,negative,@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
8188,negative,@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
8189,negative,@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
8190,negative,@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
8191,negative,"@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief."
8192,positive,"@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem."
8193,negative,@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
8194,negative,"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
8195,negative,@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
8196,negative,@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
8197,negative,@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
8198,negative,@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
8199,negative,@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
8200,negative,@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
8201,negative,@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.

8207,negative,@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
8208,negative,@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
8209,negative,@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
8210,negative,"@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?"
8211,negative,"@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks"

8225,positive,@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
8226,negative,@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
8227,negative,@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
8228,negative,@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
8229,negative,@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?

8231,negative,@USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands...

8236,negative,@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine

8253,negative,@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
8254,negative,@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!

8259,negative,@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows

8261,negative,@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
8262,negative,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
8263,negative,@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
8264,negative,@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
8265,negative,@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
8266,negative,@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
8267,negative,@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
8268,negative,@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
8269,negative,@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
8270,negative,"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"
8271,negative,"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("
8272,negative,@USAirways thanks for nothing
8273,negative,@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
8274,negative,"@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails."
8275,negative,@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
8276,positive,@USAirways thank you
8277,negative,@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
8278,negative,"@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form."
8279,negative,"@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times."
8280,negative,"@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled."
8281,negative,@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
8282,negative,@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I‚Äôll ride US for life

8299,negative,@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
8300,negative,"@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing."
8301,positive,"@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable."
8302,negative,@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX

8310,negative,"@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer."
8311,positive,@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.

8327,negative,@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
8328,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
8329,negative,@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has

8332,positive,@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
8333,negative,@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
8334,negative,@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
8335,positive,@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you

8345,negative,@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
8346,negative,@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.

8381,negative,"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
8382,negative,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
8383,negative,@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
8384,positive,@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
8385,negative,@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #

8393,negative,"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
8394,negative,@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
8395,negative,"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
8396,negative,"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."""
8397,negative,"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"
8398,negative,@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
8399,positive,@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
8400,positive,@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
8401,negative,@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
8402,negative,@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
8403,negative,@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
8404,negative,@USAirways what is the damn delay????
8405,negative,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
8406,negative,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
8407,negative,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
8408,negative,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
8409,negative,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
8410,negative,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
8411,negative,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
8412,negative,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
8413,negative,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
8414,negative,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
8415,positive,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
8416,negative,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
8417,negative,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
8418,negative,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
8419,negative,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
8420,negative,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
8421,negative,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
8422,negative,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
8423,negative,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
8424,negative,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
8425,positive,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
8426,negative,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
8427,negative,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
8428,negative,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
8429,negative,@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
8430,negative,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
8431,negative,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
8432,negative,"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
8433,negative,@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
8434,negative,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
8435,negative,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
8436,negative,"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"
8437,negative,@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
8438,negative,"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
8439,negative,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
8440,negative,@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
8441,negative,@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
8442,negative,@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
8443,negative,@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
8444,negative,@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
8445,positive,@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
8446,negative,@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
8447,positive,@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
8448,negative,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
8449,negative,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
8450,negative,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
8451,negative,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
8452,negative,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
8453,negative,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
8454,negative,"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
8455,positive,@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
8456,negative,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
8457,negative,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
8458,negative,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
8459,negative,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
8460,negative,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
8461,negative,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
8462,positive,"‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!"
8463,negative,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
8464,positive,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
8465,negative,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
8466,negative,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
8467,positive,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
8468,negative,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
8469,negative,@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
8470,negative,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
8471,negative,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
8472,negative,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
8473,negative,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
8474,negative,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
8475,negative,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
8476,negative,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
8477,negative,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
8478,negative,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
8479,negative,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
8480,negative,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
8481,negative,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
8482,negative,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
8483,negative,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
8484,negative,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
8485,negative,@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
8486,negative,"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
8487,negative,"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!"
8488,negative,@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
8489,negative,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
8490,negative,@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
8491,negative,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
8492,negative,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
8493,negative,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
8494,negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
8495,negative,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
8496,negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
8497,negative,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
8498,negative,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
8499,negative,"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
8500,positive,@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
8501,negative,@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
8502,positive,@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
8503,positive,"@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!"
8504,negative,@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
8505,negative,"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
8506,negative,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
8507,negative,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
8508,positive,"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
8509,negative,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
8510,negative,@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
8511,negative,"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
8512,negative,@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
8513,negative,"@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE."
8514,negative,@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
8515,negative,@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
8516,negative,"@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost"
8517,negative,"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
8518,negative,"@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ"
8519,positive,@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!

8522,negative,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
8523,negative,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
8524,negative,"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
8525,negative,"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)"
8526,negative,@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
8527,positive,@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
8528,negative,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
8529,negative,@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
8530,negative,@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
8531,negative,@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
8532,negative,"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"
8533,positive,@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(

8535,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
8536,negative,@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
8537,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
8538,positive,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
8539,negative,@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
8540,negative,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
8541,positive,"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
8542,positive,@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
8543,negative,@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
8544,negative,@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
8545,negative,@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
8546,negative,@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
8547,negative,@USAirways 4420 delayed further?

8551,negative,@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
8552,positive,"@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,"
8553,positive,@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
8554,negative,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
8555,negative,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
8556,negative,@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
8557,negative,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
8558,negative,@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
8559,negative,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
8560,negative,@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
8561,negative,@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
8562,negative,@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
8563,negative,@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
8564,negative,@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
8565,negative,"@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more"
8566,negative,"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."

8572,negative,@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
8573,negative,@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
8574,positive,"@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!"
8575,positive,@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
8576,negative,@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
8577,negative,@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
8578,negative,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"
8579,negative,"@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad."
8580,negative,@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
8581,negative,@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
8582,negative,"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
8583,negative,@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
8584,negative,@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
8585,negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
8586,negative,@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
8587,negative,@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
8588,negative,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
8589,negative,@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
8590,negative,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
8591,negative,@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
8592,negative,"@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?"
8593,negative,@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
8594,negative,@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
8595,negative,@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
8596,negative,@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
8597,negative,@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative

8607,positive,"@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery"
8608,positive,@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!

8618,negative,@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.

8674,negative,@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA

8676,negative,@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service

8697,negative,@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
8698,negative,@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
8699,negative,@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation

8710,positive,@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
8711,positive,@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
8712,negative,@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
8713,negative,@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
8714,negative,@USAirways delays to the max
8715,positive,@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
8716,negative,@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA

8721,negative,@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
8722,negative,@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
8723,negative,@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.

8725,positive,@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
8726,negative,@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
8727,negative,@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
8728,negative,@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
8729,negative,@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
8730,positive,@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
8731,positive,@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
8732,negative,@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
8733,negative,"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
8734,negative,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
8735,negative,"@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?"
8736,negative,@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
8737,negative,@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
8738,negative,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
8739,negative,@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
8740,negative,@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers

8742,negative,"@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where..."
8743,negative,@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
8744,negative,@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
8745,negative,@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
8746,negative,@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
8747,negative,@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
8748,negative,@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
8749,negative,‚Äú@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.‚Äù Confirmation code?

8753,negative,"@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :("
8754,negative,@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
8755,negative,@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
8756,negative,@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
8757,negative,"@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks"
8758,negative,@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
8759,negative,"@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good"
8760,negative,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
8761,negative,"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."

8816,negative,@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?

8819,negative,@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
8820,negative,@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.

8829,negative,"@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone."
8830,negative,@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
8831,negative,@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
8832,negative,"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
8833,negative,@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?

8852,negative,@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?

8854,negative,"@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options"

9150,negative,@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
9151,negative,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?

9446,positive,@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
9447,negative,@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
9448,negative,@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
9449,negative,"@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice"
9450,negative,"@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."
9451,negative,@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
9452,negative,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
9453,negative,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
9454,negative,@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
9455,negative,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
9456,negative,"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
9457,negative,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
9458,negative,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
9459,negative,@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.

9467,positive,"@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx"
9468,positive,@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
9469,negative,@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
9470,negative,@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
9471,negative,"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
9472,negative,@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait

9477,negative,@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
9478,negative,@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.

9481,negative,@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
9482,negative,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
9483,negative,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
9484,negative,@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
9485,negative,@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
9486,positive,@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
9487,negative,@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
9488,negative,@AmericanAir Fuck you.

9492,negative,@americanair Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend
9493,negative,"@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase"
9494,negative,"@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
9495,positive,@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
9496,positive,"@AmericanAir @dfwairport Guys, let it go. http://t.co/vOxcghciJi"

9503,negative,"@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out."
9504,negative,@AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
9505,negative,@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.
9506,negative,"@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after"
9507,negative,@AmericanAir since you don't care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept
9508,negative,@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
9509,positive,"@AmericanAir 
I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?"
9510,positive,@AmericanAir if I could fly an md80/dc10 I would be so happy I live that plane so much md80 is love md80 is life.
9511,negative,"@AmericanAir It's been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks"
9512,negative,@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
9513,negative,"@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!"
9514,negative,@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat

9520,negative,"@AmericanAir just look at RDU airport. please think about the safety of your passengers. we cant get to RDU safely!

http://t.co/wDyEkVB1Ze"
9521,negative,@AmericanAir Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight?
9522,negative,@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
9523,positive,@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
9524,negative,@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska üòí
9525,negative,@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
9526,negative,@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
9527,negative,@AmericanAir I need refund.
9528,negative,"@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS"
9529,negative,@AmericanAir why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory???
9530,negative,@AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
9531,negative,@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
9532,negative,"@AmericanAir stop sending me back to ""customer relations ""I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!"
9533,negative,@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
9534,negative,"@AmericanAir 
Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks"
9535,negative,@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
9536,positive,@AmericanAir Kudos to the captain and crew for handling fustrated people while dealing with the preventable issues and shortcomings by maint
9537,negative,@AmericanAir Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate w/companies forU!
9538,negative,"@AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can't help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh"
9539,negative,"@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length."
9540,negative,@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
9541,negative,@AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
9542,negative,@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
9543,negative,@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
9544,negative,@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
9545,negative,"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."
9546,positive,@AmericanAir Thanks for the quick response - it's appreciated!
9547,negative,@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
9548,positive,@AmericanAir thanks for the update
9549,negative,@AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman
9550,negative,@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
9551,negative,"Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?‚Äù"
9552,negative,"@AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no?"
9553,negative,@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
9554,negative,@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
9555,positive,@AmericanAir Lets hope it stays that way.Big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the US the last month. Great FB post yesterday.
9556,negative,"@AmericanAir 
Hello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this?"
9557,positive,@AmericanAir my boss is :)
9558,negative,"@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber."
9559,negative,@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should‚Äôve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
9560,positive,@AmericanAir Your response has been incredible. Truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. Big thank you üòÑ
9561,negative,"@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths"
9562,negative,@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
9563,negative,@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
9564,negative,"@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home."
9565,negative,"@AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we‚Äôre told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don‚Äôt."
9566,negative,@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
9567,negative,@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?

9569,negative,@AmericanAir My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can't fix it?
9570,negative,"@AmericanAir Is it possible to change the FF number on a passenger on a Flight Booking Problems, it won't let me change it?"
9571,positive,@AmericanAir great thank you

9577,positive,@AmericanAir Thank you for the quick customer service today. #RefundProcedureNotTooPainful I know that Winter Weather is not your fault.
9578,negative,"@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land."
9579,negative,@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
9580,negative,@AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!
9581,negative,@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
9582,negative,@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
9583,negative,"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"
9584,negative,"@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW."
9585,positive,"@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago."
9586,negative,"@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service."
9587,positive,"@AmericanAir although you have no control of the weather, you came through with a great customer service"
9588,negative,@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
9589,negative,@AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn't help me.
9590,negative,"@AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can't use &amp; can't change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2"
9591,negative,@AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!
9592,negative,@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
9593,positive,@AmericanAir I wish I could remember all of their names!
9594,negative,@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
9595,negative,@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
9596,positive,"@AmericanAir thank you AA, this is how I always start my vacations http://t.co/dzKc3auZU9"
9597,negative,"@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?"
9598,negative,@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
9599,negative,"@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!"
9600,positive,"@AmericanAir Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation!"
9601,negative,@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
9602,negative,@AmericanAir when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
9603,positive,@AmericanAir thank you for replying. Trying to figure out how to get from there from DFW
9604,negative,@AmericanAir don't merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee

9609,negative,@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
9610,positive,@AmericanAir Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive.
9611,negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 @flyLAXairport. No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!!
9612,negative,@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can‚Äôt be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
9613,negative,"@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff."
9614,positive,"Thank you, @AmericanAir! Much appreciated."
9615,negative,@AmericanAir I‚Äôm still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
9616,positive,"@AmericanAir mission accomplished today, Thank you!"
9617,negative,@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
9618,negative,@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
9619,negative,"@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!"
9620,negative,@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
9621,negative,@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
9622,negative,@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
9623,positive,@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
9624,negative,@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
9625,negative,"@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."
9626,negative,"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."
9627,negative,"@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU"

9632,positive,@AmericanAir great job TYR ground crew...now let's get this bird outta here!!!  Tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes!
9633,negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
9634,negative,"@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."
9635,negative,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
9636,negative,"@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that"
9637,negative,@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
9638,negative,@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
9639,positive,@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
9640,negative,@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
9641,negative,"@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a ""we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"""
9642,negative,@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
9643,positive,@AmericanAir Thank you.
9644,negative,@AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don't have time to do that. #terrible
9645,negative,@AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
9646,negative,"@AmericanAir having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline's website will allow seat selection?"
9647,negative,@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
9648,negative,@AmericanAir I fly weekly with you and haven't seen one
9649,negative,"@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll"
9650,negative,"@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?"
9651,negative,@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
9652,negative,@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
9653,negative,@AmericanAir That‚Äôs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn‚Äôt understand e-mail 101.
9654,positive,@AmericanAir thanks! Flight 2160 today. Great crew!
9655,negative,@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
9656,negative,"@AmericanAir If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using ""weather"""

9665,negative,@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
9666,negative,@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
9667,negative,@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
9668,negative,"@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning"
9669,negative,@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
9670,positive,"@AmericanAir @USAirways Statement wasn't sent yesterday like Jeanine said. After I even called last night as well. Again, excellent service"
9671,negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
9672,negative,@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
9673,negative,@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land üò≠
9674,negative,@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
9675,negative,@AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can't file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg
9676,negative,"@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!"
9677,negative,"@AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes...."
9678,negative,@AmericanAir is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur
9679,negative,"@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care"
9680,negative,@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
9681,negative,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
9682,negative,@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
9683,negative,@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
9684,negative,"@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX"
9685,negative,@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
9686,negative,"@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in."
9687,negative,"@AmericanAir would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep."
9688,negative,@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
9689,negative,"@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?"
9690,negative,@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt
9691,negative,@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
9692,negative,@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow
9693,negative,@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
9694,negative,"@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead."
9695,negative,@AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd
9696,negative,".@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue."

9701,negative,"@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling."
9702,negative,"@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping"
9703,negative,@AmericanAir We all did! Skipper's walk-around too :(
9704,negative,@AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
9705,negative,@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
9706,negative,"@AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??"
9707,negative,@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
9708,negative,@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
9709,negative,"@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care."
9710,negative,"@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!"
9711,negative,"@AmericanAir nothing, you have done enough."

9718,negative,@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
9719,negative,@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
9720,negative,"@AmericanAir I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no"
9721,negative,"@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should"
9722,negative,@AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
9723,negative,@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
9724,negative,@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation

9726,negative,@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude üò°üò°
9727,negative,@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
9728,negative,@AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
9729,negative,"@AmericanAir I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company ""doesn't issue refunds for phone bills"" help!phone will be shut off"
9730,negative,"@AmericanAir TY! But, their site says "" Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ..."""

9733,negative,"@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine."
9734,negative,"@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?"
9735,negative,@AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
9736,negative,"@AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service"
9737,negative,"@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around"
9738,negative,@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
9739,negative,@AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible
9740,negative,@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
9741,negative,@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they'd call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!!
9742,negative,@AmericanAir *does = doesn't
9743,negative,@AmericanAir Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It's a very small item.
9744,negative,@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!

9750,negative,"@AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour."
9751,positive,@AmericanAir but your flight crews &amp; ground crews have handled situation well. Texting notification let me catch a few winks during delay.
9752,positive,@AmericanAir Thx! I hope so. IAH to DFW to OKC has turned out to be a LONG trip today and I have to work tomorrow.
9753,negative,@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.
9754,negative,"@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow"
9755,negative,"@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation."
9756,negative,@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
9757,negative,@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
9758,negative,@AmericanAir I DM'd you
9759,positive,@AmericanAir thank you! My lost item was located at ORD and is being returned to me.
9760,negative,Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
9761,negative,"@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event"
9762,negative,@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
9763,negative,@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
9764,negative,"@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time."
9765,negative,Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
9766,negative,@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. üëéüò°‚úàÔ∏è #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm

9772,negative,@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
9773,negative,@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?

9777,positive,@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible
9778,negative,@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
9779,negative,@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
9780,negative,.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
9781,negative,@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
9782,negative,"@AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm."

9788,negative,"@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience"
9789,negative,@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
9790,negative,@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
9791,negative,@AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this
9792,positive,"@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane,looks stunning!"

9797,negative,@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
9798,negative,"@AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn't. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day"
9799,negative,@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
9800,negative,@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH üòÅ
9801,negative,"@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?"

9809,negative,"@AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah ""I"" got it rebooked"
9810,positive,@americanair Not surprised that you were the Fastest Responding US Brand on Twitter for Q2 + Q3 2014. Also 10th fastest in the world in Q3
9811,negative,@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
9812,negative,"@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral."
9813,negative,"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""

9840,positive,@AmericanAir Just followed you.
9841,negative,@AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable

9850,positive,Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
9851,negative,@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
9852,negative,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
9853,negative,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
9854,negative,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke

9858,negative,@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
9859,negative,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
9860,negative,@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
9861,negative,@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
9862,positive,@AmericanAir I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help
9863,negative,@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
9864,negative,"@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen."
9865,negative,@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
9866,positive,@AmericanAir thanks
9867,negative,"@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service"

9873,negative,@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
9874,negative,@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
9875,negative,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
9876,negative,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
9877,negative,"@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?"
9878,negative,@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
9879,negative,@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
9880,negative,@AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?

9884,negative,@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
9885,negative,"@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!"
9886,negative,@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
9887,positive,"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
9888,negative,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
9889,negative,@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
9890,negative,@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.

9893,negative,"@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry"
9894,negative,@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
9895,negative,@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting

9900,positive,"Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come"
9901,negative,@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
9902,negative,@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
9903,negative,@AmericanAir im still on hold...
9904,negative,@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
9905,negative,@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
9906,negative,@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.

9909,negative,"@AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort.."
9910,negative,@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
9911,negative,@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
9912,negative,"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
9913,negative,"@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????"
9914,positive,@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
9915,positive,@AmericanAir He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?

9926,negative,@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
9927,negative,"@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
9928,negative,@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.

9934,positive,"@AmericanAir @maryella_green just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
9935,negative,@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.

9940,negative,@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
9941,negative,@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?

9989,negative,@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans üëÄ
9990,negative,@AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably
9991,negative,"@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes"

10004,negative,"@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service."

10010,negative,"@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week."

10028,negative,"@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!"
10029,negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
10030,negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
10031,negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after

10042,negative,"@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
10043,negative,@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
10044,negative,@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
10045,negative,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
10046,negative,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
10047,negative,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
10048,negative,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
10049,negative,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
10050,negative,@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
10051,negative,@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
10052,negative,@AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left!
10053,negative,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
10054,negative,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
10055,negative,@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
10056,positive,@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
10057,negative,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
10058,negative,@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
10059,negative,@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
10060,negative,@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
10061,negative,"@AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz?"

10068,negative,"@AmericanAir can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air..."
10069,negative,@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
10070,negative,@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
10071,negative,@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt

10074,positive,@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!
10075,negative,@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!

10077,negative,@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
10078,negative,"@AmericanAir I really can't there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out!"
10079,negative,"@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!"
10080,negative,@AmericanAir Hi. Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y?
10081,negative,@AmericanAir there's an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn't fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291
10082,positive,@AmericanAir thanks... I finally got through this afternoon.  :)

10094,negative,"@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?"
10095,positive,"@AmericanAir thank you, truly appreciate the help, just sent a DM"
10096,negative,"@americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don't answer, #hardtodo"
10097,negative,@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck

10127,positive,@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
10128,negative,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.

10139,positive,@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
10140,negative,"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
10141,positive,"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
10142,negative,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
10143,negative,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
10144,negative,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
10145,negative,"@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
10146,negative,@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)

10154,negative,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
10155,positive,@AmericanAir thanks
10156,negative,@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
10157,negative,@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply

10189,negative,@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling

10207,negative,@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
10208,positive,@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
10209,negative,@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it

10214,negative,@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
10215,negative,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers

10224,negative,@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
10225,negative,@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
10226,negative,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"

10422,negative,@AmericanAir can you?
10423,negative,@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.

10459,positive,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
10460,negative,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
10461,negative,@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
10462,negative,@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
10463,negative,@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
10464,negative,@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!

10470,negative,"@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent."

10472,negative,@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
10473,negative,@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
10474,negative,"@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can"""
10475,positive,@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
10476,negative,@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
10477,negative,@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
10478,negative,@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
10479,negative,@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
10480,negative,@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.

10494,positive,@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
10495,negative,"@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye""."
10496,negative,@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
10497,negative,@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
10498,negative,@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
10499,negative,@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.

10506,negative,@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
10507,negative,@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
10508,negative,@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
10509,negative,@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
10510,negative,@AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
10511,negative,@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.

10513,negative,.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
10514,negative,"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."

10519,negative,@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
10520,positive,@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!

10681,negative,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
10682,negative,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.

10948,negative,@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
10949,negative,@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
10950,negative,"@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!"
10951,negative,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
10952,negative,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
10953,negative,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
10954,positive,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)

10959,negative,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
10960,negative,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
10961,negative,"@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"
10962,positive,@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
10963,negative,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
10964,negative,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
10965,positive,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
10966,negative,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
10967,negative,@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
10968,negative,@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
10969,negative,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
10970,negative,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
10971,negative,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
10972,negative,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
10973,negative,@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
10974,negative,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
10975,negative,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
10976,negative,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
10977,positive,@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
10978,negative,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
10979,negative,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
10980,negative,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
10981,negative,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
10982,negative,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
10983,positive,"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."
10984,positive,Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
10985,negative,@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
10986,negative,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
10987,negative,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
10988,negative,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
10989,negative,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
10990,negative,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
10991,negative,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
10992,negative,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines"
10993,negative,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
10994,negative,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
10995,negative,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
10996,negative,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
10997,negative,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
10998,negative,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
10999,positive,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
11000,negative,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
11001,negative,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
11002,positive,@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
11003,negative,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
11004,negative,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥"
11005,negative,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
11006,negative,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
11007,negative,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
11008,negative,"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
11009,negative,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
11010,negative,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
11011,negative,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
11012,negative,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
11013,negative,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
11014,negative,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
11015,negative,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
11016,negative,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
11017,negative,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
11018,negative,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
11019,negative,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
11020,negative,@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
11021,negative,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
11022,negative,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you‚Äôve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
11023,negative,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
11024,negative,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
11025,negative,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
11026,negative,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
11027,negative,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
11028,negative,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though üòí I'm really mad about the situation"
11029,negative,"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"
11030,negative,"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."
11031,negative,"@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
11032,negative,@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
11033,negative,@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
11034,negative,@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
11035,positive,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
11036,negative,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
11037,negative,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
11038,negative,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
11039,negative,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
11040,negative,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
11041,negative,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
11042,positive,@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
11043,negative,@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
11044,negative,@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
11045,positive,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
11046,negative,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
11047,positive,@AmericanAir thanks for the show! üëç
11048,negative,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
11049,positive,@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
11050,negative,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
11051,negative,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
11052,negative,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
11053,negative,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
11054,negative,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
11055,positive,@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
11056,negative,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°
11057,negative,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
11058,negative,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
11059,negative,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
11060,negative,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
11061,negative,"@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
11062,negative,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
11063,negative,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
11064,negative,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
11065,negative,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
11066,positive,@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
11067,negative,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
11068,negative,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
11069,negative,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
11070,negative,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
11071,negative,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
11072,negative,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
11073,positive,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
11074,negative,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
11075,negative,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
11076,negative,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
11077,negative,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
11078,negative,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
11079,negative,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
11080,negative,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
11081,negative,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
11082,negative,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
11083,negative,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
11084,negative,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
11085,negative,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
11086,negative,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
11087,negative,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
11088,negative,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
11089,negative,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
11090,negative,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
11091,negative,@AmericanAir Close down
11092,positive,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
11093,positive,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
11094,negative,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
11095,negative,@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
11096,negative,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
11097,negative,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
11098,negative,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
11099,negative,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
11100,negative,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
11101,negative,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
11102,negative,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
11103,negative,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
11104,negative,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
11105,negative,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
11106,negative,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
11107,negative,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
11108,negative,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
11109,negative,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
11110,negative,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
11111,negative,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
11112,negative,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
11113,negative,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
11114,negative,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
11115,negative,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
11116,negative,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
11117,negative,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
11118,negative,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
11119,negative,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
11120,negative,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
11121,negative,@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
11122,negative,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
11123,positive,"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
11124,negative,"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
11125,negative,@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
11126,negative,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
11127,negative,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
11128,negative,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
11129,negative,@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
11130,negative,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
11131,negative,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
11132,negative,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
11133,negative,"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
11134,negative,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
11135,negative,@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
